# Ethereum-KickStart
This is a web server for people to define a donation campaign. Participants of a donation campaign can decide the receiver of this donation.<br>
The web application is developed using React and Next.js. It is not using create-react-app, because I found that Next.js has many advantages compared with create-react-app when building a multi-page application.<br>
<br>
The steps to develop an Ethereum web application, or a Blockchain web application generally, are:<br>
1, Using remix.ethereum.org to develop/debug the smart contract.<br>
2, Create your web application folder and run npm to init and install the needed npm modules to build a React front-end application.<br>
3, Download your smart contract from the Remix.ethereum.org into your project folder. And use Mocha to develop the test code to test your smart contract.<br>
4, Begin to implement the front-end application after your smart contract is tested and verified.<br>
<br>
To run it, you need to have an account in Ethereum network. To sign up in Ethereum network, do the followings:<br>
1, install Google Chrome browser.<br>
2, install MetaMask as Chrome's extension.<br>
3, apply for an account using MetaMask. Get some ethers for testing purpose: Go to faucet.rinkeby.io. or Go to rinkeby-faucet.com.<br>
